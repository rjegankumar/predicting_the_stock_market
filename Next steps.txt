\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 There's a lot of improvement still to be made on the indicator side, and we urge you to think of better indicators that you could use for prediction.\
We can also make significant structural improvements to the algorithm, and pull in data from other sources.\
Accuracy would improve greatly by making predictions only one day ahead. For example, train a model using data from 
\f1\fs34 \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 1951-01-03
\f0\fs40 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2  to 
\f1\fs34 \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 2013-01-02
\f0\fs40 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 , make predictions for 
\f1\fs34 \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 2013-01-03
\f0\fs40 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 , and then train another model using data from 
\f1\fs34 \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 1951-01-03
\f0\fs40 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2  to 
\f1\fs34 \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 2013-01-03
\f0\fs40 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 , make predictions for 
\f1\fs34 \cf4 \cb5 \strokec4 2013-01-04
\f0\fs40 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 , and so on. This more closely simulates what you'd do if you were trading using the algorithm.\
You can also improve the algorithm used significantly. Try other techniques, like a random forest, and see if they perform better.\
You can also incorporate outside data, such as the weather in New York City (where most trading happens) the day before, and the amount of Twitter activity around certain stocks.\
You can also make the system real-time by writing an automated script to download the latest data when the market closes, and make predictions for the next day.\
Finally, you can make the system "higher-resolution". You're currently making daily predictions, but you could make hourly, minute-by-minute, or second by second predictions. This will require obtaining more data, though. You could also make predictions for individual stocks instead of the S&P500.\
